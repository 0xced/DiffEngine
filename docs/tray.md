### Moves

"Pending Moves" will accept the changes to file3 and file4.

Clicking "file3" or "file4" will accept the changes to  "file3" or "file4" respectively. Hover over the menu item to see the full path of both files.


### Deletes

A since test can produce multiple resulting snapshots. If the accepted versions has a different number of snapshots to the current test run, then some of those snapshots need to be deleted. The deletes functionality in the tray tool handles this scenario.

"Pending Deletes" will delete file1 and file2.

Clicking "file1" or "file2" will delete "file1" or "file2" respectively. Hover over the menu item to see the full path.


### Accept all

"Accept all" will accept all pending moves and all pending deletes.
