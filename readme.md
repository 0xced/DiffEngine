## Launching a tool

A tool can be launched using the following:

<!-- snippet: DiffRunnerLaunch -->
<a id='snippet-diffrunnerlaunch'/></a>
```cs
DiffRunner.Launch(tempFile, targetFile);
```
<sup><a href='/src/DiffEngine.Tests/DiffRunnerTests.cs#L14-L16' title='File snippet `diffrunnerlaunch` was extracted from'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-diffrunnerlaunch' title='Navigate to start of snippet `diffrunnerlaunch`'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endsnippet -->

Note that this method will respect the above [difference behavior](#detected-difference-behavior) in terms of Auto refresh and MDI behaviors.


## Closing a tool

A tool can be closed using the following:

<!-- snippet: DiffRunnerKill -->
<a id='snippet-diffrunnerkill'/></a>
```cs
DiffRunner.Kill(tempFile, targetFile);
```
<sup><a href='/src/DiffEngine.Tests/DiffRunnerTests.cs#L25-L27' title='File snippet `diffrunnerkill` was extracted from'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-diffrunnerkill' title='Navigate to start of snippet `diffrunnerkill`'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endsnippet -->

Note that this method will respect the above [difference behavior](#detected-difference-behavior) in terms of MDI behavior.


## File type detection

DiffEngine use [EmptyFiles](https://github.com/SimonCropp/EmptyFiles) to determineif a given file or extension is a binary or text.


## Security contact information

To report a security vulnerability, use the [Tidelift security contact](https://tidelift.com/security).Tidelift will coordinate the fix and disclosure.
